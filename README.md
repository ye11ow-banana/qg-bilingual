# qg-bilingual

Prototype repository for bilingual (EN/UA) answer-aware question generation using transformer models.

## Project plan
See [docs/project_plan.md](docs/project_plan.md) for the current analytical overview, experimental plan, and immediate action items derived from the diploma assignment.

## Status
- Code implementation is not yet present; configuration scaffolding lives in `configs/`.
- Next steps focus on data preparation, training pipeline wiring, and evaluation harnesses as outlined in the plan document.

## Train (T5-base aware)
Run the answer-aware question generation training loop with the provided YAML config:

```
uv run python -m qg_bilingual.train --config configs/train_t5_base.yaml
```
